You have no enemy you say,
Alas my friend, the Boast is poor,
He who has mingled in the fray of the duty where the brave endures must have made foes,
If you have none, small is the work you have done.
You hit no traitor on his hip,
You've dashed no cup from the perjured lip,
You've not turned no wrong to right,
You've been a coward in the fight.
- Poem recited by Margaret Thatcher(Former PM of UK) a.k.a The Iron Lady
